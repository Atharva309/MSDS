    "KerasTuner is an easy-to-use, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework that solves the pain points of hyperparameter search. Easily configure your search space with a define-by-run syntax, then leverage one of the available search algorithms to find the best hyperparameter values for your models. KerasTuner comes with Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, and Random Search algorithms built-in, and is also designed to be easy for researchers to extend in order to experiment with new search algorithms.\n",

    "KerasCV can be understood as a horizontal extension of the Keras API: the components are new first-party Keras objects (layers, metrics, etc) that are too specialized to be added to core Keras, but that receive the same level of polish and backwards compatibility guarantees as the rest of the Keras API.\n",
