    "All CU Boulder students must complete the mandatory Community Equity training online in Canvas. This non-credit online course covers university policy and resources addressing discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct. Students will also learn skills for helping as a bystander and for supporting friends. This will be done after you are admitted to the MS-DS program - you do not need to worry about this step until then. \n",
