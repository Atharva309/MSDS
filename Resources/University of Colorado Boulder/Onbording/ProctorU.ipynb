    "### How MS-DS Uses Virtual/Remote Proctoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Some for-credit MS-DS courses feature a proctored experience at the end of the course. This is generally an exam, but may also be a project-based experience. The University of Colorado Boulder takes academic integrity seriously, and is committed to ensuring that your MS-DS degree accurately represents your competency and retains its value in the marketplace. Protecting the integrity of the course exams is part of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakes of the proctored experiences in MS-DS courses are high. When you gain access to these protected items on the Coursera platform, you are no longer eligible for a tuition refund if you decide to drop the course, and you are no longer eligible for a course withdrawal. Accessing the protected examination means that you will only be eligible for an earned grade based on performance.\n",
