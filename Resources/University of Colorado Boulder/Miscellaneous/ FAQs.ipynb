    "### For-Credit Courses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start directly in a for-credit course or enroll in the non-credit version first to preview course content. You may upgrade from non-credit to for-credit at any time during the enrollment window. See the calendar for exact dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Our for-credit courses offer a different experience than our non-credit courses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Set dates:  For-credit courses have session start and end dates. Each session is 8 weeks long. See the calendar for exact dates. All for-credit coursework must be submitted by the last day of the 8-week session, and tuition cannot be carried over to future terms.\n",
    "    - CU tuition: For-credit tuition is paid to the University of Colorado Boulder and Includes access to additional CU services. (e.g. online library and alumni/career services, CU on Coursera membership, and an @colorado.edu email address).\n",
    "    - Academic support: For-credit courses are supported by course facilitators through weekly office hours, discussion forums, and email.\n",
    "    - CU credit: Students receive academic credit for their for-credit courses on a transcript from the University of Colorado Boulder.\n",
    "    - Mandatory onboarding: Prior to accessing for-credit content for the first time, you must pass a short (4–5 hours) non-credit onboarding course. You only need to complete this course once. \n",
    "    - Additional materials: Additional material and assessments must be completed to earn credit; these materials are only available to students who pay tuition. \n",
    "    - Saving work off-platform: Due to their interactive nature, discussion board posts and peer-graded assignments may not transfer from session to session if you drop/withdraw and later re-enroll in a particular class. Be sure to save your work outside of the Coursera platform.\n",
    "    - Recommended course load: We recommend new student take 1 course in their first session. And we encourage continuing students to take no more than 3 courses per session, which is equivalent to a full-time graduate-level course load. For every one credit hour, you will spend approximately 5–8 hours total each week. This includes videos, discussions, readings and assignments. Students who take 3 courses per session complete the degree in about 2 years. You must complete all courses within 8 years.\n"

    "### Are there exams?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Courses may include project-based assessments and/or online proctored exams that use ProctorU, an online proctoring service that ensures exam integrity and accountability. ProctorU requires a computer, Internet connection, and webcam and monitors students in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By using secure identity verification to ensure that the person taking the test is the correct student.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By employing a human proctor to monitor the test taker through a webcam. You will be connected to a real person to guide you through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A proctor watches the test-taker’s screen in real-time and can see everything the student is doing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- ProctorU is available 24/7; however, you must test your equipment and schedule your proctoring session at least 72 hours in advance of your desired session. To test your equipment, take the ProctorU System Test. For more information, see the ProctorU Test-Taker Resource Center.\n",

    "\n",
    "- After admission to the degree, your cumulative GPA will include all attempted for-credit coursework. This includes any courses you failed before gaining admission to the degree. However, you are allowed to retake your original pathway courses and try to improve your grade. See the MS-DS Student Handbook for details about course repetition and grade replacement.\n"
