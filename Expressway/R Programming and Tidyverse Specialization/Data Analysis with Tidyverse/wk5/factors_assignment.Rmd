# Please complete all the tasks listed below. After completing the tasks download the .Rmd file and upload in the peer review item for grading.

# Additionally please write text between the code chunks explaining what each code chunk is about.

# Refer the linked online textbook in case of any issues.


Load the stringr and forcats library

1.From the "forcats" library load gss_cat data. Explore the distribution of rincome (reported income). What makes the default bar chart hard to understand? How could you improve the plot?

2. What is the most common religion? What is the most common partyid?

3.Which relig does denom (denomination) apply to? How can you find out with a table? How can you find out with a visualisation?

4.How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent changed over time? Plot a suitable chart.

5.Collapse "rincome" into smaller set of categories?


```{r}
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load gss_cat data and explore the distribution of rincome
data(gss_cat)
rincome <- gss_cat$rincome

# Default bar chart
barplot(table(rincome))

# The default bar chart is hard to understand because the x-axis labels are rotated and overlapping, making it difficult to read the income categories. Additionally, the bars are ordered alphabetically instead of in a meaningful order.

# Improved plot
income_counts <- table(rincome)
income_df <- data.frame(income = names(income_counts), count = as.numeric(income_counts))

# Reorder income categories based on their logical order
income_df$income <- factor(income_df$income, levels = c("Lt $1000", "$1000 to 2999", "$3000 to 3999", "$4000 to 4999", "$5000 to 5999", "$6000 to 6999", "$7000 to 7999", "$8000 to 9999", "$10000 to 12499", "$12500 to 14999", "$15000 to 17499", "$17500 to 19999", "$20000 to 22499", "$22500 to 24999", "$25000 or more"))

# Create a horizontal bar chart with clear labels
ggplot(income_df, aes(x = count, y = income)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "Income", title = "Distribution of Reported Income") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"))

# The improved plot provides a clearer visualization of the distribution of reported income with properly ordered income categories and readable labels.

# 2. Find the most common religion and partyid
most_common_religion <- names(which.max(table(gss_cat$relig)))
most_common_partyid <- names(which.max(table(gss_cat$partyid)))

most_common_religion
most_common_partyid

# 3. Find out which relig does denom apply to using a table and visualization
denom_by_relig <- table(gss_cat$relig, gss_cat$denom)
denom_by_relig

denom_by_relig_plot <- ggplot(data = gss_cat, aes(x = relig, fill = denom)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Religion", y = "Proportion", title = "Denomination by Religion") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

denom_by_relig_plot

# By using a table or a visualization, we can find out which denominations (denom) apply to each religion (relig).

# 4. Plot the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent over time
# Plot the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent over time
partyid_over_time <- gss_cat %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(partyid) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))

# Define colors for the party identification categories
party_colors <- c("Democrat" = "blue", "Republican" = "red", "Independent" = "gray")

ggplot(partyid_over_time, aes(x = year, y = proportion, fill = partyid)) +
  geom_area(position = "stack", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Proportion", title = "Proportions of Party Identification Over Time") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = party_colors, labels = names(party_colors)) +
  theme_minimal()

# The chart shows how the proportions of party identification (Democrat, Republican, Independent) have changed over time.

# 5. Collapse "rincome" into smaller set of categories
collapsed_rincome <- gss_cat %>%
  mutate(rincome_collapsed = case_when(
    rincome %in% c("Lt $1000", "$1000 to 2999", "$3000 to 3999") ~ "Low Income",
    rincome %in% c("$4000 to 4999", "$5000 to 5999", "$6000 to 6999") ~ "Middle Income",
    rincome %in% c("$7000 to 7999", "$8000 to 9999", "$10000 to 12499") ~ "Upper Middle Income",
    TRUE ~ "High Income"
  ))

table(collapsed_rincome$rincome_collapsed)
