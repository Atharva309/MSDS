    "a) Efficient numerical operations: NumPy provides a powerful N-dimensional array object that allows efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays of numerical data. It provides various mathematical functions and operators that can be applied element-wise on arrays, resulting in fast and optimized computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Broadcasting: NumPy's broadcasting feature enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes, automatically aligning the arrays to perform element-wise computations. This feature simplifies and speeds up array operations, reducing the need for explicit looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Linear algebra capabilities: NumPy offers a comprehensive suite of linear algebra functions, including matrix operations, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition, and more. These capabilities make it a valuable tool for scientific computing and data analysis.\n",

    "Pandas:\n",
    "a) Powerful data manipulation: Pandas provides high-level data structures such as DataFrame and Series, which offer flexible and efficient ways to manipulate and analyze structured data. It allows easy data indexing, slicing, merging, reshaping, and aggregating, making complex data operations intuitive and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Data alignment and missing data handling: Pandas automatically aligns data based on labeled indexes, allowing easy integration and analysis of different datasets. It provides robust methods for handling missing or incomplete data, including automatic data filling, interpolation, and dropping missing values.\n",
