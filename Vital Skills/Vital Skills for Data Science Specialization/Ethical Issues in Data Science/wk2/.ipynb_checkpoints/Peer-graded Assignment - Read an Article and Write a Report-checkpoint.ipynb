    "[1]To say that a viewpoint is “reasonable” is to say that it is the kind of view that someone who was thinking critically about ethics might actually hold for justifiable reasons.

    "Exclusive: Yahoo secretly scanned customer emails for U.S. intelligence - sources\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "The article reports that Yahoo secretly built a custom software program in 2015 to scan all incoming emails for specific information requested by U.S. intelligence agencies. Yahoo complied with a classified government demand, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts. This incident is believed to be the first known case where a U.S. internet company searched all incoming messages based on a government request. The specific details of the information sought by the intelligence officials are unknown. Yahoo's compliance with the directive resulted in the departure of its Chief Information Security Officer, Alex Stamos. Yahoo claimed to be a law-abiding company but did not provide further comment on the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issues in Data Ethics:\n",
    "- Privacy and Surveillance: The article raises concerns about the privacy of users' communications and the extent of surveillance conducted by government agencies. Users expect their emails to remain private, and the secret scanning program challenges the notion of privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transparency and User Consent: Yahoo's decision to comply with the government's request without informing its users raises questions about transparency and user consent. Users were not aware that their emails were being scanned, potentially violating their trust in the service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issues discussed in the article highlight the need for stronger consideration of data ethics principles by both governments and internet companies. While the article does not explicitly mention any ethical framework, we can evaluate the situation using the framework of consequentialism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The handling of the issues discussed in the article is problematic from an ethical standpoint. The secret scanning program compromises user privacy and fails to provide transparency and informed consent to Yahoo's customers. The lack of involvement of the security team and the programming flaw that exposed the stored emails further exacerbate the ethical concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Aspects from the articl:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transparency and User Notification: Internet companies should be transparent about any requests or actions that may compromise user privacy. In this case, Yahoo should have informed its users about the scanning program and obtained their consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Safeguarding User Privacy: Internet companies must prioritize the privacy and security of their users' data. They should implement robust security measures, encryption protocols, and data access controls to protect user information from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Legal Challenges: Companies should challenge overly broad government requests that compromise user privacy through legal means. This can involve questioning the legality and proportionality of the demands, as well as advocating for transparency in surveillance practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ethical Guidelines and Compliance: Internet companies should establish internal ethical guidelines for handling government requests involving user data. These guidelines should prioritize user privacy, transparency, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Collaboration with Civil Liberties Organizations: Internet companies should collaborate with civil liberties organizations to advocate for privacy rights, engage in policy discussions, and seek guidance on handling government requests in an ethically responsible manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these additional steps, internet companies can better align their actions with ethical principles, protect user privacy, and maintain the trust of their customers in an increasingly connected world.\n"
