    "[1]To say that a viewpoint is “reasonable” is to say that it is the kind of view that someone who was thinking critically about ethics might actually hold for justifiable reasons. Consideringreasonabledifferences of ethical opinion helps to avoid what is known as a straw man fallacy:this happens when we characterize one or the other viewpoint as wrong based on the weakest arguments for it."
