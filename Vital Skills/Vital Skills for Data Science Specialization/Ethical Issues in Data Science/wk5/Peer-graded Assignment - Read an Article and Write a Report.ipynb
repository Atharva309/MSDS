As a result, healthcare organizations can achieve more efficient use of their marketing budget and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns using personalization, resulting in higher ROI.\n",
    "Human Intervention in Healthcare Predictive Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "In a data-driven healthcare environment, keeping the human element in mind is essential. The principle of human-centered design is the basis for creating healthcare technology and programs. They are easy to understand and use for patients and enable accurate decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics models are based on historical and real-time data and statistical algorithms. This can sometimes produce results that may be biased and not consistent with real-world medical knowledge or practice. Human healthcare professionals, such as doctors and nurses, are essential to validate the predictions made by the analytical models. Also, they can interpret the results in the context of a patient's unique clinical situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, human intervention is critical for healthcare predictive analytics. Medical experts can cross-check and validate analytical models' predictions and help ensure that they are accurate and clinically relevant.\n"
