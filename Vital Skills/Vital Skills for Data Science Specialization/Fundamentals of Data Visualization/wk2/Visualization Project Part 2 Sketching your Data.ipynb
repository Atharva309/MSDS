    "Although optional, participation in these weekly discussion activities is strongly recommended. Throughout this course you will learn techniques to comprehend clientsâ€™ data needs, craft visualization solutions, and evaluate your solutions. Discussion board activities allow you to practice and reflect on these concepts within the context of a discipline or problem area relevant to you. \n",

    "For those taking this course as part of the Masters in Data Science, the activities are essential building blocks for the final project. By engaging in these activities/discussions on a weekly basis, you will avoid having to prepare everything for the final project all at once. \n",

    "Your Module 1 discussion post identified some high-level goals for working with a dataset of interest to you. In this post, you will expand on those goals to characterize your target problem and develop some low-fidelity prototypes for working with that data. First, identify two to three tasks you would wish to complete with your data, identifying: \n",
