    "Although optional, participation in these weekly discussion activities is strongly recommended. Throughout this course you will learn techniques to comprehend clients’ data needs, craft visualization solutions, and evaluate your solutions. Discussion board activities allow you to practice and reflect on these concepts within the context of a discipline or problem area relevant to you. \n",

    "Locate a dataset that you are interested in working with. The data should be sufficiently complex that you can ask lots of questions about it and engage in creative design techniques, but not so complex that you need specialized hardware or algorithmic approaches to analyze. While you are welcome to use any data you’d like, I recommend that your datasets are tabular (e.g., CSV, TSV, SQL, etc.), contain 5,000 or fewer datapoints (on the order of one hundred or so tends to be sufficiently interesting without causing lag in Altair), and is data that you’re comfortable discussing as part of the course (e.g., avoid data that is overly private or classified). \n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss your dataset, including the data’s source, key attributes/dimensions of the data, and your goals for working with that data (i.e., what are the key questions you want to answer). Identify existing relevant visualizations for working with that data (either using the same data, showing the same concepts, or just that might provide some inspiration) and critique those visualizations based on the practices from this module.

    "- Survival Rate by Embarkation Port: Pie chart or bar chart showing survival rates by embarkation port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critique of Existing Visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Survival Rate by Gender: This visualization effectively shows the difference in survival rates between genders, but it could be enhanced by adding percentages or relative proportions to better compare survival rates.\n",
    "- Survival Rate by Ticket Class: Similar to the gender visualization, this one could benefit from adding percentages or relative proportions to the bars for better comparison.\n",
    "- Age Distribution: This histogram provides a good overview of the age distribution of passengers, but it could be improved by adding labels and a title to make it more informative.\n",
    "- Survival Rate by Age Group: A bar chart or box plot showing survival rates by age group could provide a clearer understanding of how age correlates with survival. However, it's important to ensure that age groups are properly defined and labeled.\n",
    "- Survival Rate by Embarkation Port: While a pie chart or bar chart can show survival rates by embarkation port, it's essential to consider whether this information is relevant to our goals and whether there are better ways to visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while these visualizations provide valuable insights into different aspects of the Titanic dataset, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity, labeling, and contextual relevance to our analysis goals. We'll aim to create visualizations that address these aspects as we explore the dataset further.\n"
