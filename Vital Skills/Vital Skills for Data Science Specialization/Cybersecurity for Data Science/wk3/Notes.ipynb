    "# The Truth about Hackers, in Black and White (and Grey)\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.webroot.com/blog/2020/04/23/the-truth-about-hackers-in-black-and-white-and-grey/\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know there are three primary types of hacker—white hats, black hats, and grey hats—and that there are subcategories within each one? \n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as ethical hackers, white hats are coders who test internet systems to find bugs and security loopholes in an effort to help organizations lock them down before black hat hackers, i.e. the bad guys, can exploit them. Black hats, on the other hand, are the ones we’re referring to when we use words like “cybercriminal” or “threat actor.” These are hackers who violate computer security and break into systems for personal or financial gain, destructive motives, or other malicious intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last of the three overarching types, grey hat hackers, are the ones whose motives are, well, in a bit of a grey area. Similar to white hats, grey hats may break into computer systems to let administrators know their networks have exploitable vulnerabilities that need to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You mentioned subtypes. What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many groups, there’s a wide range of hacker personas, each with different motivations. Here are a few of the basic ones you’re likely to encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Kiddies\n",
    "\n",
    "When you picture the stereotypical “hacker in a hoodie”, you’re thinking of a Script Kiddie. Script Kiddies are programming novices who have at least a little coding knowledge but lack expertise. Usually, they get free and open source software on the dark web and use it to infiltrate networks. Their individual motives can place them in black, white, or grey hat territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hacktivists\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever hear of a group of hackers called Anonymous? They’re a very well-known example of a hacktivist group who achieved notoriety when they took down the CIA’s website. Hacktivists are grey hat hackers with the primary goal of bringing public attention to a political or social matter through disruption. Two of the most common hacktivist strategies are stealing and exposing sensitive information or launching a denial of service (DDoS) attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Hats\n",
    "\n",
    "Red hats are sort of like grey hats, except their goal is to block, confound, or straight-up destroy the efforts of black hat hackers. Think of them like the vigilantes of the hacker world. Rather than reporting breaches, they work to shut down malicious attacks with their own tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nation-State\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember earlier in this post when we mentioned that some black hats are sponsored by governments? That would be this group. Nation-state hackers are ones who engage in espionage, social engineering, or computer intrusion, typically with the goal of acquiring classified information or seeking large ransoms. As they are backed by government organizations, they are often extremely sophisticated and well trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Malicious Insiders\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the more overlooked threats to a business is the malicious insider. An insider might be a current or former employee who steals or destroys information, or it might be someone hired by a competitor to infiltrate an organization and pilfer trade secrets. The most valuable data for a malicious insider is usernames and passwords, which can then be sold on the dark web to turn a hefty profit."

    "To solve the integrated security problem, there is a need to understand each part of the IoT ecosystem. It is crucial to understand and evaluate the cyber-security integration points to know where the security risks are emerging in the connected CAGS ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality today is that the encryption technology is commoditized. While entities across NGIOA can choose to encrypt data at the application level, the database level, the storage level, or the network level, it is essential to understand the differences between encrypting at different levels and what parameters should decide this choice. It is also important to know whether all data needs to be secured in the same manner and how integrated security networks will evolve.\n",

    "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/21/how-a-fish-tank-helped-hack-a-casino/\n",
    "\n",
    "The hackers attempted to acquire data from a North American casino by using an Internet-connected fish tank, according to a report released Thursday by cybersecurity firm Darktrace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fish tank had sensors connected to a PC that regulated the temperature, food and cleanliness of the tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Somebody got into the fish tank and used it to move around into other areas (of the network) and sent out data,” \n",
    "\n",
    "As for what people can do to protect themselves against these kinds of attacks, customers should educate themselves about IoT products and take advantage of any security protection the product offers, Nigam said. He added that people should use the latest operating systems and software and constantly update them.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Phishing\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the easiest ways to become infected with malware –Ransomware anyone? – is through phishing. With a phishing attack, the bait is an email containing personal information hackers have collected through prior reconnaissance. Crafted to look like an official communication from a legitimate source (Fedex, UPS), the phish mail is intended to catch the victims off guard, duping them to click on a link that takes them to a non-legitimate web site or opening a file attachment containing a malware payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pretexting aka Impersonation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pretexting is really a more direct instance of phishing that relies on old-fashioned person-to-person interactions. Typically, a phone call is involved.  Fun fact: Hannibal Lecter knew how to  pretext!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Baiting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Baiting is like a phishing, but the attacker dangles and entices the victim with an exciting offer. It could be in the form of a free download – music, movie, book — or a USB flash drive with a logo labeled, “Confidential Company Roadmap”.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quid Pro Quo (This for That)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to baiting,  a Quid Pro Quo also lures but with a practical benefit – usually a service – such as “Please help me with my computer!” Instead of fixing the problem, the attacker installs malware on the victim’s computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Piggybacking (or Tailgating)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Piggybacking happens in the non-virtual world, involving a person tagging along with a legitimate employee who is authorized to enter a restricted area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution?  Implement one of the most basic security tips: set your PC to lock after inactivity!"

    "\n",
    "Next, she \"spoofs\" his phone number in a call to his phone company — masking the real number she's calling from with what a customer-service representative would see as being Roose's number. This is just step one in convincing the company that Clark is legitimate.\n",

    "#  Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/avoiding-social-engineering-and-phishing-attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a social engineering attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a social engineering attack, an attacker uses human interaction (social skills) to obtain or compromise information about an organization or its computer systems. An attacker may seem unassuming and respectable, possibly claiming to be a new employee, repair person, or researcher and even offering credentials to support that identity. However, by asking questions, he or she may be able to piece together enough information to infiltrate an organization's network. If an attacker is not able to gather enough information from one source, he or she may contact another source within the same organization and rely on the information from the first source to add to his or her credibility.\n",
    "What is a phishing attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing is a form of social engineering. Phishing attacks use email or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization. For example, an attacker may send email seemingly from a reputable credit card company or financial institution that requests account information, often suggesting that there is a problem. When users respond with the requested information, attackers can use it to gain access to the accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing attacks may also appear to come from other types of organizations, such as charities. Attackers often take advantage of current events and certain times of the year, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "    Natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, Indonesian tsunami)\n",
    "    Epidemics and health scares (e.g., H1N1, COVID-19)\n",
    "    Economic concerns (e.g., IRS scams)\n",
    "    Major political elections\n",
    "    Holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a vishing attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vishing is the social engineering approach that leverages voice communication. This technique can be combined with other forms of social engineering that entice a victim to call a certain number and divulge sensitive information. Advanced vishing attacks can take place completely over voice communications by exploiting Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions and broadcasting services. VoIP easily allows caller identity (ID) to be spoofed, which can take advantage of the public's misplaced trust in the security of phone services, especially landline services. Landline communication cannot be intercepted without physical access to the line; however, this trait is not beneficial when communicating directly with a malicious actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a smishing attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smishing is a form of social engineering that exploits SMS, or text, messages. Text messages can contain links to such things as webpages, email addresses or phone numbers that when clicked may automatically open a browser window or email message or dial a number. This integration of email, voice, text message, and web browser functionality increases the likelihood that users will fall victim to engineered malicious activity.\n",
    "What are common indicators of phishing attempts?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suspicious sender's address. The sender's address may imitate a legitimate business. Cybercriminals often use an email address that closely resembles one from a reputable company by altering or omitting a few characters.\n",
    "    Generic greetings and signature. Both a generic greeting—such as \"Dear Valued Customer\" or \"Sir/Ma'am\"—and a lack of contact information in the signature block are strong indicators of a phishing email. A trusted organization will normally address you by name and provide their contact information.\n",
    "    Spoofed hyperlinks and websites. If you hover your cursor over any links in the body of the email, and the links do not match the text that appears when hovering over them, the link may be spoofed. Malicious websites may look identical to a legitimate site, but the URL may use a variation in spelling or a different domain (e.g., .com vs. .net). Additionally, cybercriminals may use a URL shortening service to hide the true destination of the link.\n",
    "    Spelling and layout. Poor grammar and sentence structure, misspellings, and inconsistent formatting are other indicators of a possible phishing attempt. Reputable institutions have dedicated personnel that produce, verify, and proofread customer correspondence.\n",
    "    Suspicious attachments. An unsolicited email requesting a user download and open an attachment is a common delivery mechanism for malware. A cybercriminal may use a false sense of urgency or importance to help persuade a user to download or open an attachment without examining it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you avoid being a victim?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Be suspicious of unsolicited phone calls, visits, or email messages from individuals asking about employees or other internal information. If an unknown individual claims to be from a legitimate organization, try to verify his or her identity directly with the company.\n",
    "    Do not provide personal information or information about your organization, including its structure or networks, unless you are certain of a person's authority to have the information.\n",
    "    Do not reveal personal or financial information in email, and do not respond to email solicitations for this information. This includes following links sent in email.\n",
    "    Don't send sensitive information over the internet before checking a website's security. (See Protecting Your Privacy for more information.)\n",
    "        Pay attention to the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a website. Look for URLs that begin with \"https\"—an indication that sites are secure—rather than \"http.\"\n",
    "        Look for a closed padlock icon—a sign your information will be encrypted.\n",
    "    If you are unsure whether an email request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the company directly. Do not use contact information provided on a website connected to the request; instead, check previous statements for contact information. Information about known phishing attacks is also available online from groups such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group. (See the APWG eCrime Research Papers).\n",
    "    Install and maintain anti-virus software, firewalls, and email filters to reduce some of this traffic. (See Understanding Firewalls for Home and Small Office Use, Protecting Against Malicious Code, and Reducing Spam for more information.)\n",
    "    Take advantage of any anti-phishing features offered by your email client and web browser.\n",
    "    Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA). (See Supplementing Passwords for more information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do you do if you think you are a victim?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you believe you might have revealed sensitive information about your organization, report it to the appropriate people within the organization, including network administrators. They can be alert for any suspicious or unusual activity.\n",
    "    If you believe your financial accounts may be compromised, contact your financial institution immediately and close any accounts that may have been compromised. Watch for any unexplainable charges to your account.\n",
    "    Immediately change any passwords you might have revealed. If you used the same password for multiple resources, make sure to change it for each account, and do not use that password in the future.\n",
    "    Watch for other signs of identity theft. (See Preventing and Responding to Identity Theft for more information.)\n",
    "    Consider reporting the attack to the police, and file a report with the Federal Trade Commission."
