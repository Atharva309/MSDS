    "**Ryan:** All right. So one of the articles that I just read was about dark hotel, ABT. They established a fake site to impersonate the internal email system used by the WHO, the World Health Organization. And I guess they were trying to get email addresses and passwords, I guess, from users. Is that something that are you familiar with? Is that something you would see in your everyday or no?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ruth:** So I work mostly with internal [redacted], but that doesn't mean that, you know, I try and keep on top of all the latest bad guys I like to go to. So kind of to translate it down a little bit for, I can turn on like one of the reasons why when you go to a website, [redacted], and this whole privacy thing going on, you have to click the button, you know, is because anything that can be on a business card is considered personal, identifiable information. Right? So about April comes down to her con essence. You have some guy, you can call a call on the phone, you know. Hey, you know, where is this for email? Hey, they got it from wherever. Is it one point, [redacted] left their directory on the internet? It wasn't a big deal. Yeah. But what that does is it allows them to, you know, just spoofing, you know, phishing, or whaling, so another one they use, where they try and get the executives. So you'll find is a lot of people who are kind of more savvy. When they go on LinkedIn, they don't necessarily put their full job title because someone who's doing a con essence is going through LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, whatever you want to say, right? And they're looking for those titles. Because certain titles mean you have certain privileges, right? So for example, you know, I put out a mine compliance and assurance because I help everyone do their compliance and make sure that you're doing it. I used to put IT security analyst. But what that triggers people is, hey, she has some extra permissions that media people don't. Yeah. Right? So a lot of that, it's extremely common for an email to be used, you know, a company directory. Just recently, I didn't just have to be a mortgage company, Mr. Cooper, just had a breach where, and we don't know all the details, right? But they shut down their entire mortgage system for my payments and things. So apparently it seems that people's emails can start to send out information. And for those emails, they add a deem, an email, maybe they add an account number. And then they went to the banks and said, oh, this person has a payment. So, you know, we changed our ADA number. You know, this is where it needs to go in. So they could have siphoned off all that money with just a couple of things, right? You know, so that one really comes down to reconnaissance. A lot of stuff is for reconnaissance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ryan:** So how do you protect or how would you protect or do you have like a game plan when you consult with people and say, okay, this is how we're going to prevent this from happening, or this is the best safeguards or this is the training you need. How would you go about doing that?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ruth:** It is a multi-faceted answer, right? Just depending on the industry, right? You're going to treat healthcare companies different or an electric grid company differently, right? Because you have critical infrastructure and then you have HIPAA laws. So regulatory, right? Both of those are more regulatory. But HIPAA is your personal information, right? It's your health information. There are certain laws and regulations that only information is visible by certain people. But me, the patient, I sign a paper, don't read it, and I find it later that that healthcare company uses a third party. I need to store that data. So usually what [redacted], not the place that I understand, but [redacted] are most, I'll say security vendors. What I'll do is say, okay, here is the healthy hygiene. In other words, tell your users, don't do these things, right? Be sure where your information is going. Your third party suppliers, make sure you're competitive. Make sure you sign a paper that says, as a data controller, they call it, that they are properly managing all that data to protect it, right? Where's some guy puts it on a drive and throws it in their laptop, right? Or in their bag? Is there a backup plan? What happens and how are they going to proactively determine if something unusual is happening, right? So even internally, you know, we try, you know, the food that we tell everybody else, right? So, ITSS is based on the NIST framework, the guidelines for, you know, information security. And so there are things like monitor what you have, which in itself is a whole division of people, right? Because you need to have the attackers, the hackers, right? Both good and bad hackers. Because a lot of these companies, the bad guys now are getting money. And you either have nation states that are attacking. This isn't the kid or the young guy who's got their computer messing around anymore, right? Especially with more AI, right? As things become easier, the easier it is for a bad guy to do something, the quicker we have to realize, hey, someone could do this. The proactive is usually what I deem an internal and externally. It's the biggest impact for a company. And don't you have, try to figure out how you're going to protect it and think of all the crazy ideas, right? It used to be in the old days, you know, you used to, you know, look at the person behind you, you know, do you have a badge to get in? They call that tailgating.  Now, now it's, okay, you gave somebody access. Well, it's a quarter later or it's six months later, but you surely still need it. There's that constant proactive kind of activity. So it's mostly, you tell companies, you know, be proactive, monitor your stuff. It's worth paying for the software to help protect you. But when you get that vendor, and this is the hardest part, and you know, make some people in Spirci or, you know, make some crazy a little bit when they really think about it, you have to realize something long before an attacker does. Right? So you have to some really smart folks. You've got to hire some of those hacker types and say, okay, I'm going to give you this car. Can you get into it? Because now it's all computerized, right? So a really good story is the Jeep. I think it was the Jeep. There's a guy who tried to tell, I think it was Chrysler. Is it Chrysler? He told me to try, he said, hey, listen, I can manipulate this car from my living room. I put something underneath the dashboard, and I'm done. Well, wireless, now everyone has wireless in the car. You know, how well are these protecting that? So those, even those crazy things, IoT gives people nightmares. Yeah. Yeah. Right? So that's proactive. Give the vendor who understands what they have and what they can have. And then, hey, listen, you've got a monitor, right? Most attacks are 120 days ago. So you don't even know until much later that something's happened. How would we reduce that down is what many researchers are trying to do now, right? Those people, that's more than me, have a PhD. Okay. Can I use your question? I hope a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ryan:** So yeah, you kind of touched on a little bit earlier. So, and this probably might even, you might have even answered it. So I wrote this question down. And today's rapidly evolving threat landscape. Which strategies do you use to stay updated on the latest cyber security threats and trends? Yeah. How do you stay up to date on the latest trends and threats, I guess?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ruth:** So it's a wonderful time job. Yeah. They can be tough. Yeah. So what I get to limit to my email because email works for me because I can my phone or a podcast. I use podcasts from smart folks, right? And I try to find, I've got to see different podcasts. But pick a subject that you're interested in. I'm really interested in industrial control systems. It's not what I do, right? But if anything's going to happen to like the electric grid or my hot pot at home, right? How are they, what it just means, how are they securing the transformers? How are they securing, you know, those nuclear plants? You know, I can now, in my electricity, I can look online and up to the second, right? That means that there's something on my meter that they're able to wirelessly get to. Well, how are they securing, right? I got to go out and fix stuff. How are they fixing it remotely? So now you're just me. So podcasts, some, I think one is called dark web, web site. Try to find some of those industry. And a lot of the times in LinkedIn, you'll see some of the names, or some will give you, eight years to top ten places that I like to go. And we're kind of working to some of them that you like. Like, leaping computers pretty good. And much like news, you got to find the ones that are accurate, right? And have good reporting that are unbiased. The other thing I do is, I think it's everywhere, I really thought of this. I went to Marist in Gibson, New York, and their library is open to me forever, right? So periodically, I'll go onto the library and I'll just type in industrial control, or risk management. And I'll go look for the journals. Because they're peer reviewed, so that means they're pretty accurate, right? Someone's taken its time to read them, they're a write them. Someone's published them. So peer reviewed journals, web sites, and podcasts. But the biggest ones are usually the web sites and the podcasts. If I have a spare half hour, I'll listen to a podcast. You just got to work it in there, and that's kind of helps your technical vitality. You get the latest words. Like, I just got my masters recently, and something I had never heard of was network virtualization. I just kind of confused me. You mean I could take a network device and now virtualize it to do the same thing, you know, that a protection system does? And you could do that virtually. That just, again, security kind of runs my mind. How do you protect that? Yeah. Right? So it's called NFV, and that was very interesting. So like, that's something new I learned, right? So I'll go out and I'll go find, you know, what's the latest plans in security? What it is, kind of you have to go look, right? And when in article picture interest, trying to get a little more, right? You know, I also bought a couple of books about hacking. You don't always have to get the certifications, but their study guides are pretty good for keeping you current. Yeah, which... So that's something to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ryan:** Which certifications would... do you think are useful in that field?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ruth:** It depends what role you want to play, right? Yeah. Surprised ethical hacker is really good. I got the books. I gave you insight on how they do proactive penetration assessment. Yeah. Right? What they looked for. And certainly at [redacted], there's the... what do they call them? Key controls over operations. So I'll go through and read. Okay. These are the questions that I wanted to ask. And how would I give them that information? So there's ethical hacker. There's... now there's CISM. Certified information security manager. So if you're going to be more of that management, that paperwork person, either CISS\n"
