    "\n",
    "The attacks, one attributed to the DarkHotel Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. The attempt to steal passwords from WHO agency staff is a stark reminder that cybercriminals are actively exploiting the ongoing pandemic. The attackers, leveraging a fake site mimicking our internal email system, initiated the assault on March 13, prompting our cybersecurity team, along with external experts, to respond swiftly. \n",

    "\n",
    "Given the severity of the situation and the potential impact on our organization, I urge each one of you to prioritize cybersecurity vigilance. Please ensure your teams are briefed on the heightened threat level and actively participate in cybersecurity drills to test our incident response playbook.\n",

    "Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any immediate concerns or insights, do not hesitate to reach out.\n"
