If you have any issues getting the https link to work for the COVID dataset  refer back to the step-by-step instructions in the video. Make sure to check your quotations, backslashes, dashes, etc., so that it is exactly the same as in class. In case you still have any issues, the full links are here, but it is strongly encouraged that you go through the process of getting the https address yourself off the website. \n",
