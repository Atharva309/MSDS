    "Note that the running time of _findCrossOverIndexHelper_ for inputs $x,y$ of size $n$ is $\\Theta(\\log(n))$. This is because, each iteration of the algorithm halves the search region and the algorithm terminates when the search region has size $2$. This requires at most $\\Theta(\\log(n))$ iterations by the same argument as that presented for binary search in the lecture video.\n",

    "\n",
    "We note that since $j$ is assumed to be integer cube root of $n$, we have\n",
    "$j^3 \\leq n$ and  $(j+1)^3 > n$. We have $\\text{left} < j+1$ and likewise $\\text{right} > j$. Therefore, $\\text{left} \\leq j < \\text{right}$.\n",

    "$k/2^i$ with each merge operation taking $n \\times 2^{i}$ time. The overall work done at the $i^{th}$ iteration remains $k \\times n$. There are $\\Theta(\\log(k))$ iterations in all. Therefore, the overall complexity is $\\Theta(n k \\log(k))$.\n"
