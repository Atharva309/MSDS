    "\n",
    "Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course covers basics of algorithm design and analysis, as well as algorithms for sorting arrays, data structures such as priority queues, hash functions, and applications such as Bloom filters, count-min sketches and string matching.\n",
    "MS-DS Program Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful completion of this course demonstrate your achievement of the following learning outcomes for the MS-DS program:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acquire, clean, wrangle, and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the principles of efficient algorithms for dealing with large scale data sets and be able to select appropriate algorithms for specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and be able to apply the main computational techniques used to analyze large data sets, including a variety of data mining and machine learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the principles of computer representation, storage and access of large data sets and be able to determine the appropriate approaches for specific problems.\n",

    "Drops, Tuition Refunds, and Withdrawals\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the MS-DS has flexible course start dates, all drops, tuition refunds, withdrawals and grades are handled at the individual course level. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor these deadlines. Coursera and CU Boulder are not responsible for notifying the students of these deadlines. For approximate session timelines, access the Boulder MS-DS Onboarding Course via the MS-DS degree homepage. To drop or withdraw from a course please complete the appropriate form on the CU Boulder Office of the Registrar website.\n",

    "Drops and Refunds\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student has 14 days from a class start date or their enrollment date (whichever is later) to request a drop for 100% tuition refund. Students are only eligible to drop a course if they have not accessed the restricted content (timed proctored exam) or received a grade.  When a course is dropped under these conditions, it will not appear on the student’s record.\n",
    "Withdrawal\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who request to drop the course after the 14-day period and who have not accessed the timed proctored assessment may withdraw from the course but will not receive a refund. When a student withdraws from a course under these conditions, the student will receive a grade of W on their academic record. W grades have no bearing on the GPA and credit total.\n",
