    "An experimental design refers to a meticulously planned research approach that enables researchers to maintain a level of control over a specific variable being manipulated, such as administering a medication, while simultaneously observing the subsequent changes in another variable, such as a measure of overall well-being. This stands in contrast to observational studies, where researchers lack the ability to control the application of treatments to the subjects within their sample. Instead, they gather and analyze data without introducing any alterations to the existing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of proper experimental design is highlighted by the potential consequences of an erroneous approach. Mistakes in designing experiments can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the connections between the manipulated variable (treatment) and the variable being observed (response). This holds particular importance because the primary objective of experimental designs is to comprehend causal relationships."

    "An experimental unit denotes the subject or entity to which a specific treatment is administered. When treatments are assigned independently to multiple experimental units, this process is referred to as replication.\n",

    "It's crucial to distinguish between an experimental unit and a sampling unit. The sampling unit is the entity on which the resulting response is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this distinction, consider the following scenario:\n",
    "Imagine Company X conducts an experiment to compare the effects of four distinct advertising campaigns aimed at improving click rates. They choose four different social media platforms to host these campaigns, with each campaign shown to 1000 internet users. The researchers randomly assign each advertising campaign to one of the four social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the treatment pertains to the advertising campaigns. However, identifying the experimental units is essential. Contrary to what might be assumed, the experimental units are not the users themselves. Instead, they are the social media platforms that receive the treatments. The users, on the other hand, become the sampling units, as they are the entities from which data is collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this distinction might appear insignificant, it holds substantial importance. For instance, if one were to incorrectly assume that the experimental units were the users, it would lead to a mistaken belief in having numerous replications of each advertising campaign. In reality, true replication is absent because there are only four distinct experimental units (social media platforms)."
