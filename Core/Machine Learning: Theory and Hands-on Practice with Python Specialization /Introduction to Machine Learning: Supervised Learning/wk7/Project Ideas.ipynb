    "  **Example**: “Predicting international trade flows between major economies based on historical trade data, economic indicators, and trade agreements.”\n",
    "- Specify the scope, such as a focus on specific commodities or trade between particular regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify Data Sources:\n",
    "Use publicly available data sources like:\n",
    "- **UN Comtrade Database**: For historical trade volumes, imports, and exports data.\n",
    "- **World Bank Open Data**: For economic indicators like GDP, population, and inflation.\n",
    "- **International Trade Centre (ITC)**: For detailed trade flows and country-specific indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and Preprocess the Data:\n",
    "- Collect the relevant datasets and consolidate them into a single DataFrame.\n",
    "- Handle missing values, format dates, and perform feature engineering as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document the Problem and Data:\n",
    "- Create a brief description of the problem and a summary of the data (data types, number of rows/columns, and key features).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand the Distribution of the Data:\n",
    "- Use `histograms`, `boxplots`, and `scatterplots` to analyze trade volumes, economic indicators, and target variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualize Trade Patterns:\n",
    "- Create visualizations showing trade flows over time.\n",
    "- Use `line charts` to identify trends and seasonality in trade volumes.\n",

    "- Decide on strategies for handling missing data (e.g., fill with mean, drop rows, or interpolate).\n",
    "- Identify and handle outliers that may distort predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering:\n",
    "Create new features based on existing ones. For example:\n",
    "- Calculate the **trade balance** (exports - imports).\n",

    "  - **XGBoost Regressor**\n",
    "  - **Prophet** or **ARIMA** if using a time-series approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Evaluate the Models:\n",
    "- Train each model and evaluate using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, or **R²** scores.\n",
    "- Use **cross-validation techniques** if applicable to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "- Fine-tune hyperparameters using **grid search** or **randomized search** to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Document Results:\n",
    "- Record model performance metrics and compare different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpret the Model Results:\n",
    "- Discuss the key findings from the models.\n",
    "- Explain why some models performed better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present Trade Flow Predictions:\n",
    "- Visualize predictions vs. actual trade volumes.\n",
    "- Create a **time-series plot** showing how well the model forecasts future trade volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Analysis (Optional):\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of hypothetical scenarios (e.g., tariff changes, economic downturns) on trade flows using the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlight Key Insights for Trade Policy:\n",
    "- Provide actionable recommendations for trade organizations based on your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write a Conclusion:\n",
    "- Summarize the entire analysis, including the problem, EDA insights, model performance, and policy recommendations.\n",
