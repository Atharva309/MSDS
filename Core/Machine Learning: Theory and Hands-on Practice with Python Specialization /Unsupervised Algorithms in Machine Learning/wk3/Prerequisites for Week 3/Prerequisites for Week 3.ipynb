    "Many of us struggle with converting sparse matrices into CSR format for faster calculations. It's a common thing, and trust me it is not expected of you to remember these at all times. So I'm sharing some extra content meant for revising, and learning how to speed up your matrix operations especially involving Sparse matrices, CSR formats and utilizing Dot Products.\n",

    "We can see in our Week  3 programming assignment that we need to perform all types of matrix multiplications, with some involving a dot product between two matrix vectors. If you're stuck with this or maybe unable to remember, or even not able to think how to go about it, here's a recap of stuff that would equip you with every necessary tool.\n",
