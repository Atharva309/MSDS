    "Ryan is the proprietor of ActiveGear, a local sporting goods store that has been a staple in the community for over a decade. Recognizing the inefficiencies of the traditional paper-based filing system, Ryan has sought to modernize his operations by implementing a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). At ActiveGear, customers can find a wide range of sporting equipment, apparel, and accessories catering to various sports and outdoor activities. Ryan aims to streamline the process of managing customer information, inventory, sales transactions, and employee data through the implementation of an RDBMS.
