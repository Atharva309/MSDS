    "# WILL ELEVATING THE DIFFICULTY SCORES IMPROVE THE ODDS OF WINNING? THE CASE OF ARTISTIC GYMNASTICS EVENT FINALS\n",

    "Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The study found that there were significant differences in D scores between the QR and EF for both male and female gymnasts across all apparatus.\n",
    "- F scores in the EF were notably lower than those in the QR for men's pommel horse (PH), horizontal bar (HB), and women's balance beam (BB) and floor exercise (WFX) events.\n",
    "- Elevating D scores in the EF of PH, HB, and WFX was associated with a significantly improved chance of winning a medal.\n",
    "- The study's findings provide insights into the differences in D scores and the odds of winning a medal in the EF compared to the QR.\n",
    "- The study represents the first of its kind to compare gymnast performance between the QR and EF and offers valuable information for coaches and gymnasts to formulate competition strategies."
