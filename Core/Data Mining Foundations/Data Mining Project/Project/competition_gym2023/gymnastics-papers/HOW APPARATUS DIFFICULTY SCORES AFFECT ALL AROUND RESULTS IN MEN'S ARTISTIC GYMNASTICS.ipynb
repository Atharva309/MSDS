    "\n",
    "    - The maximum difficulty scores for each apparatus differed: Floor exercise=7.9; Pommel Horse=7.6; Rings=7.6; Vault=7.4; Parallel Bars=8.1; High Bar=8.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical analyses included Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, Pearson correlations, pair-wise t-tests, linear regression analysis, and the classification of gymnasts using Euclidian square distances.\n",
    "- Clusters were compared with one-way ANOVA and Tamahne 2 post hoc test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The study aimed to assess how gymnasts' difficulty scores influenced their performance in all-around gymnastics, particularly in light of changes in the scoring system."

    "- Data Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The descriptive statistics and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to assess the distribution of data. It was found that only the vault data D scores were not normally distributed. The score distribution was leptokurtic and skewed to the left.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Pair-wise t-tests showed significant differences between various pairs of apparatus, with the vault having the highest average D scores and pommel horse the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pearson's correlations revealed that correlations between apparatus D scores were all statistically significant and medium to high. The highest correlation with the all-around final score (AAFS) was with parallel bars D score (0.83 – 68.9% of common variance), while the lowest correlation was with the vault D scores (0.61 – 36.3% of common variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster analyses identified three groups of gymnasts. The third group had the potential to win medals based on their quality of D scores, while the first and second groups had lower D scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- D scores alone could predict 84% of the all-around final score, with parallel bars D scores being the best predictors of good all-around results."
