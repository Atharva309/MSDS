    "# UCSAS 2024 USOPC Data Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "For this data challenge, your goal is to <b>identify the group of 5 athletes who will enable the Team USA Olympic Men’s and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics teams to optimize success in Paris 2024.</b> You are tasked with developing an analytics model that can be used to identify and compare the expected medal count</b> in the 8 medal events for men (team all-around, individual all-around, floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar) and 6 medal events for the women (team all-around, individual all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, 192 artistic gymnasts will compete at Paris 2024: 96 men and 96 women. <b>Team events will feature 12 teams of 5 athletes each in the men’s and women’s events.</b>* For countries that do not win a full team entry for Paris 2024, a maximum of 3 individuals per country will be able to qualify. Those <b>remaining 36 entries for each gender will be determined by results of the 2023 World Championships, the 2024 World Cup Series, and the 2024 Continental Championships.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each gender, 3 teams qualified at the 2022 World Championships in Liverpool, England. In the men’s competition, teams from China, Japan, and Great Britain qualified. In the women’s competition, teams from the United States, Great Britain, and Canada qualified. For each gender, 9 other countries will qualify teams based on their placements at the 2023 World Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, which will take place from September 30, 2023, and October 8, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that at Tokyo 2020, men’s and women’s teams were composed of 4 athletes. Countries with full teams could also qualify up to 2 additional athletes to compete in Tokyo as individuals. The Team USA men had a 4-person team of Brody Malone, Sam Mikulak, Yul Moldauer, and Shane Wiskus. The USA men had one individual athlete, Alec Yoder, who could compete in the qualifying round at the Olympics to potentially qualify for the individual all-around and the apparatus finals. Similarly, the <b>Team USA women had a 4-person team of Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, and Grace McCallum. The USA women had two individual athletes, Jade Carey and MyKayla Skinner, who could compete in the qualifying round at the Olympics to potentially qualify for the individual all-around and the apparatus finals.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to recent news, <b>gymnasts from Russia and Belarus</b> will be allowed to take part in sanctioned competitions as “individual neutral athletes” from the start of 2024. Based on that information, Russia and Belarus will not be able to qualify for team artistics gymnastics events in Paris, but they <b>would each be able to qualify up to 3 athletes to compete as individuals</b>, as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of choosing a team is complicated by the structure of the Olympic competition. For both the men and women, the athletes first compete in a qualifying round in which their scores are used to determine advancement of teams (i.e,, countries) to the team all-around final and individuals to the individual all-around final and apparatus finals. <b>In qualifying, 4 of the 5 athletes on each team compete on each apparatus, so not every athlete will compete in all apparatus. The athletes representing countries who did not qualify a full team may participate on all apparatus in the qualifying round.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The top 8 teams in qualifying advance to the team final based on the sum of the top 3 out of 4 scores on each apparatus (“4 up, 3 count”, for a total of 18 scores for men and 12 scores for women).</b> Athletes must compete on all apparatus in qualifying to be eligible for the individual all-around final. <b>The top 24 athletes qualify for the individual all-around final, with a maximum of two gymnasts per country. The top 8 athletes on each apparatus qualify for the final in that apparatus, again with a maximum of 2 gymnasts per country.<b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the team all-around, individual all-around, and individual apparatus finals, all athletes’ scores from qualifying are thrown out. <b>In the team all-around final, the medalists are determined by the sum of the 3 scores on each apparatus (“3 up, 3 count”, for a total of 18 scores for men and 12 scores for women).</b> An athlete’s scores in the team all-around final have no effect on their scores in the individual all-around final, and in the individual apparatus finals, all previous scores from qualifying, the team all-around final, and the individual all-around final are thrown out.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The goal of this data challenge is to put together the best possible men’s and women’s Team USA Olympic Artistic Gymnastics teams, however, the meaning of “best” is left open to the interpretation of the entrant.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a few questions that students could consider for their entry include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - How would your recommended team differ if you are trying to maximize total medal count, gold medals, or a weighted medal count (e.g., 3 for gold, 2 for silver, 1 for bronze)?\n",
    "    - How would your recommended team change if you consider a team all-around medal to be more valuable than the individual all-around medals and/or if you consider the individual all-around medals to be more valuable than the individual apparatus medals? \n",
    "    - Can Team USA maximize its total medal count by selecting a team of 5 gymnasts who are all-around gymnasts, event specialists (gymnasts who focus on 1 or more apparatus but not all apparatus), or a combination of those?\n",
    "    - Under what circumstances can Team USA maximize its total medal count by selecting a gymnast who only competes on 1 apparatus (e.g., Stephen Nederoscik, 2021 pommel horse World Champion)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from major domestic and international gymnastics competitions from the seasons leading up to the 2020 Tokyo and 2024 Paris Olympics will be provided to entrants. Because <b>the Code of Points scoring system is changed each Olympic cycle, data from the years (2017-2021) leading up to the 2020 Olympics, which actually took place in 2021, should be used as a separate data set from the data from competitions in the 2022 and 2023 seasons leading up to the 2024 Olympics.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned data is on GitHub, which is being actively updated. The last update of data will be the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Belgium, which ends in early October, 2023.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Data Collection:\n",
    "- **Performance Data:** Collect detailed performance data for each gymnast, including scores in specific events (e.g., floor exercise, vault, balance beam, parallel bars, rings) in various competitions over the past few years.\n",
    "- **International Competition Data:** Gather data on how these gymnasts have performed in international competitions, including the World Championships, previous Olympics, and prestigious invitational meets.\n",
    "- **Medal History:** Collect information on each gymnast's history of winning medals in international competitions, including the type (gold, silver, bronze) and event.\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Examine the consistency of each gymnast's performance, particularly in high-pressure situations and major competitions.\n",
    "- **Injury and Health Data:** Assess the injury history and current health status of each gymnast to ensure they are physically fit for the Olympics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define Your Criteria:\n",
    "- **Medal Probability:** Create a criterion that calculates the probability of each gymnast winning a medal in their respective events based on historical performance data. You can use statistical models to estimate this probability.\n",
    "- **Event Importance:** Assign weights to each event based on the likelihood of the U.S. winning medals in those events. Events where the U.S. has historically been strong should have higher weights.\n",
    "- **Experience:** Consider the experience level of gymnasts, giving more weight to those with prior Olympic or major international competition experience, as they may be better equipped to handle the pressure.\n",

    "## Elaboration on the Data collection (from above)\n",
    "and preprocessing are critical steps in building a predictive model for estimating the probability of gymnasts winning medals in the Olympics based on historical performance data. Here's an elaboration on these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Sources**: Identify and gather data sources that contain historical performance data for gymnasts in Olympic events. These sources could include official Olympic websites, sports databases, or datasets from research institutions. Ensure that the data is comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Variables**: Determine what features (variables) you want to include in your dataset. These features should be relevant to predicting medal probabilities. Common features for this task might include:\n",
    "   - **Past Performance**: Scores or rankings in previous Olympics or competitions.\n",
    "   - **Age**: The age of the gymnast at the time of the Olympics.\n",
    "   - **Event-Specific Statistics**: Performance statistics for each gymnastics event (e.g., balance beam, floor exercise, vault).\n",
    "   - **Country**: The country the gymnast represents.\n",
    "   - **Training Metrics**: Information about the athlete's training regimen, coaching staff, or training facilities.\n",
    "   - **Injury History**: Any past injuries that might affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning**: Perform data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Missing values can be imputed using methods like mean, median, or advanced techniques like regression imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Integration**: Combine data from various sources if necessary. Ensure that the data is in a structured format such as a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Create new features that could provide valuable information for prediction. For example, you might calculate the average score of a gymnast in previous events or the total number of medals they've won in the past.\n",
    "   - Normalize or scale numerical features to ensure that they have similar scales. This is important for models like logistic regression or neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:\n",
    "   - If your dataset includes categorical variables like \"Country,\" you may need to encode them into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. This allows the model to work with these categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train-Validation-Test Split**:\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set. Common ratios are 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set for hyperparameter tuning, and the test set for final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalization or Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Depending on the choice of machine learning algorithm, you may need to normalize or standardize the feature values to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is particularly important for models like SVM or k-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - If you have an imbalanced dataset (e.g., very few gymnasts win medals compared to those who don't), consider techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights to address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection and preprocessing can be time-consuming and require domain knowledge to make informed decisions about which features to include and how to clean and prepare the data. However, these steps are crucial for building a reliable predictive model for estimating medal probabilities in the Olympics."

    "The labels in this context would represent the outcome you want to predict. Since you're trying to predict the composition of the Men's and Women's Team USA Olympic Artistic Gymnastics teams, the labels could be binary or categorical, indicating whether a gymnast is selected for the team or not. You would assign a label of \"1\" for selected gymnasts and \"0\" for those not selected. Alternatively, you could use specific categories for team roles (e.g., \"All-Around,\" \"Vault Specialist,\" \"Bars Specialist,\" \"Beam Specialist,\" \"Floor Specialist\")."
