    "Labs for the course have been published as a reading with a link to a notebook, plus a Lab Quiz. Lab notebooks do not need to be submitted. These are provided as a guided coding walk-through that you should follow step-by-step. Mostly, you simply need to execute the code that is written. There may be some small exercises for you to complete along the way. There will be questions to answer as you work through the lab. The answers to the questions should be entered into the Lab Quiz for that Lab.\n",

For this reason, be sure to download your completed assignments as .py files for submitting to the grader. To do this, in a Colab notebook go to:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Typically, this means only writing code within the context of a pre-defined function that is meant to be completed as part of the assignment. Any exploration or testing code that you write should be written below the cutoff cell.\n",
